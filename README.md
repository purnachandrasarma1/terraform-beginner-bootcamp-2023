## Semantic Versioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging. 
You can refer for more information about semantic versioning at [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

The general format is as follows:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g., `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR version** when you make incompatible API changes.

- **MINOR version** when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.

- **PATCH version** when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.
